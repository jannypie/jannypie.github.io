==================

I am a Web Developer with special interests in UX/UI and accessibility. 

As someone who loves both coding and design, I delight in bridging front-end and back-end development. My diverse background reflects curiosity, persistence, and an ability to adapt. I bring together tech skills, an artistic eye and research experience to meet the challenge of the ever-evolving user experience.
