  <h2>It all begins with a block</h2>
  <p><code>Methods</code> contain two elements: <code>parameters</code> (or variables) representing objects, and <code>blocks</code>, the action for those objects. This is the core of <strong>object-oriented programming</strong>: you have objects, and you have the action between them. Like nouns and verbs, as they say.</p>
  <p><strong>Blocks</strong> are the functional portions of methods, the portion contained between <code>def my_method</code> and <code>end</code>.
    <pre><code class="ruby">
    def my_method(param)  # I am not a block
      puts param          # I am the block!
    end                   # I am not a block
    </code></pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    Blocks are <strong>not</strong> objects! Ruby's world of Everything Is An Object, blocks are not objects. However, you <em>can</em> wrap them in a <code>Class</code> called <code>Proc</code>, which results in a <code>function</code> object, or <strong>closure</strong>.
    <pre><code class="ruby">
    Proc.new {|param| block}  # I am an object containing a block
    # Which is like writing
    def proc(param)           # I am an object containing a block
      block
    end
    </code></pre>
  </p>
  <h2>Lambdas are things</h2>
  <p>
    <pre><code class="ruby">
    def proc(param)           # I'm named "proc"
      block
    end
    lambda { |param| block}   # Equivalent function, but no name
    </code></pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    Lambdas are a special type of Proc. They are functions without names, and also <code>return</code> <strong>results</strong> in a different way. (See? Tied in the title there.) Lambdas return the last line of the method as the return value, just like we are used to seeing in methods. This is different from basic Proc behavior, which is to exit the containing method when read in a block, regardless of location in the method. Let's look at some lambda code:
    <pre><code class="ruby">
      puts Proc.new {} # => <Proc:0x007fbd8a0205e0@(irb):1>
      puts lambda {}   # => <Proc:0x007fbd8a023718@(irb):2 (lambda)>

      def return_results
       Proc.new { return "I'm in the Block" }.call    # Proc called here exits
       return "I'm in the Method"                     # us from the method
      end                                             # immediately
      # return_results => "I'm in the Block"

      def return_results
       lambda { return "I'm in the Block" }.call    # Returns results back to lambda
       return "I'm in the Method"                   # Exits us from the method
      end
      # return_results => "I'm in the Method"
    </code></pre>
  </p>
  <p>One final note:</p>
    <pre><code class="ruby">
    # BTW, writing this:
    lambda { |param| block }
    # is the same as writing this:
    lambda do |param|
      block
    end
    </code></pre>
  <p>And the very helpful resource <a href="https://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1-ruby-primer/chapters/" title="ruby monk website">rubymonk.com</a> tells us</p>
  <blockquote>[T]he convention followed in Ruby is to use <code>{}</code> for single line lambdas and <code>do..end</code> for lambdas that are longer than a single line.
