      working in tandem on the same project or piece of code.

    <h2>Why is pair programming important to DBC</h2>
    <p>
      Pair programming is great practice for getting comfortable with coding and to
      learn from and teach each other. It teaches DBC students techniques for communicating
      with each other in preparation for being in real world working environments.

    <h2>Driver vs Navigator Roles</h2>
    <p>
      The roles tend to vary amongst the people who are pairing, but drivers are usually
      writing the code and sharing their screen, while navigators are usually reviewing
      the code and guiding where the work is going. Some navigators take this to mean
      silent watching, while others prefer a more vocal role. It's important to remain
      flexible while doing both roles.
