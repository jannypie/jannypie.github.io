  <p>DEVOLIO merges traditional resume information with GitHub/Twitter activity to quickly and easily produce an attractive, informative job search profile. The app is responsive to look great on mobile at conferences, printable to look like a traditional resume, and uses D3.js to animate real activity data from GitHub. </p>
  <p>Built with: Ruby, Rails, Backbone.js, JavaScript / AJAX, MongoDB, d3.js, GitHub API, Twitter API, Bootstrap responsive grid (custom design and CSS otherwise), Sass, CoffeeScript</p>
  <p>As the Team Lead, I coordinated the project, as well as heading up the UI, visual design and code, and the Backbone.js integration.</p>

  <p>I was on a team that built this project over a weekend as practice with complex modeling and associations in a database. We implemented a full Agile workflow with frequent standups and peer-pairing, task tracking and review, and a team retro. I implemented the UI as well as vertical slices for user CRUD and some game play.</p>
  <p>Built with: Ruby, Rails, CSS</p>
