<section>
   <p>I've consistently update this site, so revisiting it for a redesign is a common activity for me. I already had my blog running Jekyll, and I did have Bootstrap CSS when I was learning how to use it, but I have since removed it in order to use 100% my own code. In addition, I already have a GitHub website tied to a custom domain (jandennison.com, my web dev portfolio repo). So, I feel that it is maturing quite nicely and in tandem with my own education.</p>
   <p>I do still feel that there is quite a bit of room for growth, as well. It's not where I want it to be quite yet, but I'm working on it a little bit at a time. I'm going for an interesting and attractive, but clean and spacious look and feel for the entire site. I plan to carry over this layout to my web development portfolio as well, so that they have a consistent look.
   </p>
   <p>I have received several good pieces of feedback about my blog, such as:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>"Nice vibrant colors on your site. It's very eye-catching!"</li>
     <li>"Love the colors and background pic in the header!"</li>
     <li>"that is a vulgar amount of mustache!"</li>
     <li>"I really like your blog layout and scheme."</li>
     <li>"The layout works well on my phone."</li>
     <li>"First impression, is oooh pretty. Scroll down, there's content! In Snoop Dogg latin too! Second impression, serious content follows the lorem ipsum."</li>
     <li>"I love the look of the website! So pretty and clean looking. Inspired."</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Some helpful, actionable feedback I've gotten has been:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>"The Introduction link brings me down to the bottom of the page, but since the intro paragraph starts midway through the view of the bottom page, I had to look around for a little bit before I actually found it. This might confused others as well."</li>
    <li>"I noticed that there are many links at the bottom, to pages I probably would have found more interesting, if I had seen them ten minutes ago. Oh look, those links are also at the top! Why did I not notice those links before?"</li>
    <li>"The way the background image loads is visually jarring, make it smaller or more subtle"</li>
    <li>General comments regarding text alignment and whitespace, and keeping link styles uniform</li>
   </ul>
   <p>I plan to take all of these and use them to better my site. I've already moved the "Introduction" section up higher on the page so that it goes to the top when the anchor link is clicked. I'm also working on a modified nav of links that I'm actually pretty excited about. My typography as well could use some playing around with until it flows just right, and I'm working on finding a balanced approach of image resolution versus compression for the big header image. Typography continues to be one of the more challenging of design for me, but I won't give up!</p>

  <p>If you're like me, you've been stuck on a coding problem at some point. Maybe more than once (she says, vastly understatingly). And after you stubbornly try to work it out for probably longer than you should, you finally realize: you need to ask someone else. Enter: asking questions on the internet. Yes, that ominous music you just heard is justified. Luckily when you're just asking coding questions, you're not likely to get into the bad internet stuff, but you are quite likely to not get any reply at all, or get the wrong reply if someone misunderstood your question. So how do you write a good question that gets the answer you need?</p>
  <h3>Good questions:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Include any background research you've done and approaches you've tried, so that people don't suggest things you already know.</li>
    <li>Include details on any software you're running that might impact results - Windows or Mac? Chrome, Firefox, IE? Which version?</li>
    <li>Are asked in places that are more likely to get replies (forums, StackOverflow, etc).</li>
    <li>Have a summary of your problem as an introduction.</li>
    <li>Include sample code snippets.</li>
    <li>Have a title summarizing your problem in one sentence.</li>
    <li>Explain your issue fully, but precisely. Don't go on and on or your readers will be moving on.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In the past, I've tried asking questions on Twitter and gotten hit-or-miss responses. Sometimes it's a great way to get short, quick answers, but sometimes it gets lost in the shuffle of people's feeds. For more in-depth answers, look on forums or Q/A sites, or look for mentors who can answer in person or through email.</p>

  <h2>Writing about conflict</h2>
  <p>Conflict is very difficult for me, and something I have worked hard on in the past to grow and develop through. As kids, my siblings and I were never taught good conflict resolution skills, to put it mildly. As a result, there was a learning curve for me for dealing with conflict in constructive and temperate ways.</p>
  <p>I've been stuck with writer's block thinking of a specific instance for too long for this post, so I'm just going to write about conflict in general. Many sources of conflict for me have come from poor communication, crossed wires, and jumping to be defensive. Almost always, the greatest emotion underlying anger I felt was frustration - whether I felt I wasn't being heard, or, honestly, that things weren't going the way I wanted. Often, I find myself wanting to defend myself, because I felt someone wasn't valuing my input, or taking my feelings into consideration.</p>
  <p>As a child who thought that normal conflict resolution meant yelling and slamming doors, active resolution took a long time to learn. Once I entered my adult years, and realized my failings, I have worked towards reprogramming my reactions. Now when I recognize a conflict has come up, I stop myself and take deep breaths. I push the pure emotion out of me and look at it for the underlying causes. I evaluate what I am trying to communicate, and what, specifically, is frustrating me about the conflict. Sometimes I do still need to step away, if the conflict is particularly intense, and collect myself in a quiet space. I'm not always successful, but I do continually try.</p>
  <p>Learning new conflict resolution skills is an ongoing process. I've gotten really great advice from friends that I work to keep in mind and practice. For example, during conflict, give the benefit of the doubt, or, assume that I am the one misunderstanding, and ask for clarification. Being generous and charitable in our dealings with others, rather than jumping to defend ourselves, has been the most effective way for me to resolve conflict not only in a way that diffuses the situation, but builds bridges for even better communication going forward.</p>

      <h3>Fearless Values</h3>

  <p>Last week, I learned about <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/definition.html" title="link to website">Stereotype Threats</a>, and I wrote a little bit about <a href="http://jannypie.github.io/dbc-c6-stereotype-threat/" title="stereotype threat blog post">times I have experienced them</a>. In review, researchers have found that times when a person is consciously aware of stereotypes surrounding one or more aspects of their identities as they relate to performance, the person is more likely to fulfill that stereotype than not. A common example is girls who are told they cannot do math often perform poorly on math, whereas girls who are not told that often don't.
  </p>
  <img src="/blog/dbc-blog-imgs/girls-are-good-at-math.png" alt="XKCD comic about girls stereotyped as bad at math" /><small><a href="http://xkcd.com/385/" title="source of comic">Source</a></small>
  <p>This week, we read about how researchers have also found a rather effective method that people can do to reduce the result of stereotype threats - <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/reduce.html#encouragingself" title="link to explanation of self-affirmation">self-affirmation</a>. Researchers found that when people are feeling a stereotype threat about themselves, when they start being afraid that they are going to prove all those comments right about their gender/race/etc., actively redirecting those thoughts into a self-affirming reflection of their core values actually works against the threat.</p>
  <p>Some of my core values (from the long list provided) include things like:
    <ul>
      <li>Personal development
        <ul>
          <li>Insight &amp; Introspection</li>
          <li>Knowledge</li>
          <li>Growth</li>
          <li>Challenge</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Equality &amp; Fairness
        <ul>
          <li>Compassion &amp; Empathy</li>
          <li>Honesty</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Helping Society
        <ul>
          <li>Friendships &amp; Community</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Creativity</li>
      <li>Balance</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Self-affirmation essentially works by actively reflecting back on one or more of your values, and using that as motivation to break out of the stereotype. For example, if I feared that I wouldn't do well in Dev Bootcamp and might fail out, I could think back about how much I value personal growth and learning, and that would make me comfortable and more likely to perform well.
  </p>
  <p>Just today I was listening to NPR's new podcast, <a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/invisibilia/" title="Invisibilia by NPR website">Invisibilia</a>, and as I was writing this was struck by the similarity of what I was writing and what I was hearing.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    We are always, always, always telling stories to ourselves, about the situation we're in, and about other people. And that story becomes a reality for us. And that's the problem.
    ... just get out there and get rejected. Sometimes it's gonna get dirty, but that's okay. 'Cause you're gonna feel better afterward. You're gonna feel like, wow, I disobeyed my fear.
    <small><a href="http://www.npr.org/2015/01/16/377519199/disappearing-fear" title="Invisibilia podcast episode on fear">Jason Comely, Invisibilia</a></small>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If I don't face my fears, I won't be able to uphold those values. If I become the stereotype, I won't uphold those values. So now I have one tool in my belt to overcome those fears, and move towards the place I want to be.</p>

      <h3>Variations in Variables: JS v Ruby</h3>

  <h2>Here, let me hold that for you</h2>
  <p><strong>Variables</strong> are staples of many programming languages, including JavaScript and Ruby. Just like we learned in high school algebra, a variable is simply a placeholder representing something else. Let's take a look at the similarities and differences in variables between Ruby and JavaScript.</p>
  <h2>X = X</h2>
  <p>In both Ruby and JavaScript, unlike algebra, programming variables can be standins for more than just numbers. Variables can hold strings, arrays, booleans, even whole objects and functions. Both can also take multiple variables declared on one line (although with different structure, and this structure isn't used very often as it's not as readable).</p>
  <pre><code>
    // JavaScript variables:
    var x = "Jan rocks";
    var y = true;
    var z = 100;
    // or
    var x = "Jan rocks", y = true, z = 100;
  </code></pre>
  <pre><code class="ruby">
    # Ruby variables:
    x = "Jan rocks"
    y = true
    z = 100
    # or
    x, y, z = "Jan rocks", true, 100
  </code></pre>
  <p>Also in both languages, variables can have either <strong>global</strong> or <strong>local scope</strong>, and are accessed simply by calling the variable name.</p>
  <pre><code class="js">
    // Javascript
    var global = "Anyone can access me!"; // this is a global variable

</code></pre></section>

      It's like algebra. That's where the similarities end though.

<section>
  <h2>It all begins with a block</h2>
  <p><code>Methods</code> contain two elements: <code>parameters</code> (or variables) representing objects, and <code>blocks</code>, the action for those objects. This is the core of <strong>object-oriented programming</strong>: you have objects, and you have the action between them. Like nouns and verbs, as they say.</p>
  <p><strong>Blocks</strong> are the functional portions of methods, the portion contained between <code>def my_method</code> and <code>end</code>.
    <pre><code class="ruby">
    def my_method(param)  # I am not a block
      puts param          # I am the block!
    end                   # I am not a block
    </code></pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    Blocks are <strong>not</strong> objects! Ruby's world of Everything Is An Object, blocks are not objects. However, you <em>can</em> wrap them in a <code>Class</code> called <code>Proc</code>, which results in a <code>function</code> object, or <strong>closure</strong>.
    <pre><code class="ruby">
    Proc.new {|param| block}  # I am an object containing a block
    # Which is like writing
    def proc(param)           # I am an object containing a block
      block
    end
    </code></pre>
  </p>
  <h2>Lambdas are things</h2>
  <p>
    <pre><code class="ruby">
    def proc(param)           # I'm named "proc"
      block
    end
    lambda { |param| block}   # Equivalent function, but no name
    </code></pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    Lambdas are a special type of Proc. They are functions without names, and also <code>return</code> <strong>results</strong> in a different way. (See? Tied in the title there.) Lambdas return the last line of the method as the return value, just like we are used to seeing in methods. This is different from basic Proc behavior, which is to exit the containing method when read in a block, regardless of location in the method. Let's look at some lambda code:
    <pre><code class="ruby">
      puts Proc.new {} # =&gt; &lt;Proc:0x007fbd8a0205e0@(irb):1&gt;
      puts lambda {}   # =&gt; &lt;Proc:0x007fbd8a023718@(irb):2 (lambda)&gt;

</code></pre></p></section>

<section>
  <p><a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/definition.html" title="info about stereotype threat">Stereotpe Threat</a> is the observance of a performance decrease when the person is aware of negative stereotypes towards one or more aspects of their identities. That's confusing to say and write. Better explained: when you're aware that some aspect of yourself (race, gender, age) is negatively associated with performance, your actual performance is impacted negatively. When you're less aware of the stereotype, the observed impact is lessened.</p>
  <p>This is a familiar occasion in my life and many others. From being the only female developer on an all-male team, to being plus-sized, to appearing much younger than I am, I can quickly call to mind times when I was acutely aware of my "failing" and that it was to blame for the discrepancy in performance. For example, when I have to have difficult conversations with another person (asking for a raise, for example), I have often thought to myself that they weren't going to take me seriously because I'm young and female. Any emotion I showed felt it would be chalked up as "She's a girl, she's just being irritable and emotional." This causes so much frustration inside of me that I do get vexed and actually start to cry. It's completely out of my control, which makes me even more frustrated, and I become so overwhelmed <em>feeling</em> the stereotype that I <em>become</em> the stereotype. I never got a raise, I was passed over for promotions.</p>
  <p>As I've gotten older, I've gotten better at pushing aside that idea in my head at the start and instead picturing myself staying calm and collected. This does actually help confrontations go better, and I feel more confident because of it. Criticism is also easier to take constructively when I decouple the feedback from the act of being a female. Once I'm not feeling guilty just for being me, I'm able to focus on the challenge in front of me.</p>

  <h2>Pairing</h2>
  <p>Paired programming has been one aspect of development that I have wanted to experience for quite a while, and part of the attraction of the Dev Bootcamp program. I knew that pairing was highly stressed in the program and was excited for that aspect. Working in tandem with other programmers or designers, business owners, back-end engineers, and more is one aspect of working in an agile manner, recommended by modern developers. Unfortunately it's something that older companies following waterfall-style workflows usually don't incorporate.</p>
  <p>Pairing with other students in my cohort and also with previous Bootcamp grads in guided sessions has been as rewarding as I had expected. It's a really great way to solve difficult problems, and to learn new approaches and techniques. It feels rewarding when I am able to provide a solution that the other person hasn't thought of, and when we are able to complete an assignment more quickly than I do on my own. The only difficult part of pairing so far has been overcoming my own anxiety and introversion and engaging with my pair.</p>
  <h2>Feedback</h2>
  <p>Part of our pairing requirements is to leave and rate feedback for others, using Dev Bootcamp's ASK guides: Actionable, Specific, and Kind. I enjoy getting feedback from my pair peers. I don't find the required radio button statements to be particularly helpful, but the written statements are. Feedback from my pairs has contained some useful tips, such as using the command line more frequently, which I incorporate into my work.</p>
  <p>Writing feedback is more difficult to do than the pairing it seems at times. It forces me to think more acutely about the pair, rather than having general "It was good" feels. The feedback that I have left has been rated well for Kindness, but I could do better on Specific and Actionable. Actionable is probably the most difficult for me because I often can't think of anything to suggest for my pair. I have kept those two in mind more when I left recent feedback and will continue to practice.</p>

  <h2>The Road from Arrays to Hashes to Classes</h2>
  <p>So far in our Ruby journey, we've learned how to use objects, then arrays, then hashes, to keep track of increasingly complex but related items. Arrays hold a simple list of items, and hashes hold labelled lists of items. Now we've entered the next chapter: how to collect groups of objects <em>and</em> the methods we want associated with them.</p>
  <p>Say you want to keep track of the kinds of dragons you spot on your adventures. You'll want to keep notes about them, and each one will be different. The best way to do so is to create a new Class of objects - Dragon - that will help you save time in your recording.</p>
  <p><pre><code>
    class Dragon(color,size,food,abilities,habitat)
      attr_accessor :color, :size, :food , :abilities, :habitat
      def initialize(color,size,food,abilities,habitat)
        @color = color
        @size = size
        @food = food
        @abilities = abilities
        @habitat = habitat
      end
    end

  <h2>They don't love you like I love you</h2>
  <p>Recently we learned a lot about Ruby and working with methods and classes. One method that I didn't really understand and thus avoided using it in my challenges was <code>map</code>. I've been introduced to the concept in both Ruby and JavaScript. I vaguely understood it to mean that, while I was looping through an <code>array1</code>, I would push the value of the current <code>array1[index]</code> to a new <code>array2[same index]</code>. I didn't really understand, so I found myself asking things like, "What's the difference between map and push? Between map and clone? Between map and dup?" - but that was before I read <a href="http://www.eriktrautman.com/posts/ruby-explained-map-select-and-other-enumerable-methods" title="Ruby Explained Blog entry on map">this blog article</a>, which made <code>map</code>, click!</p>

  <h2>One of the guys</h2>
  <p>As the sole female developer on my team of more than 20 Front End devs, the presence of women in tech is a topic that I follow closely. In the workplace I've encountered a few instances of subconcious sexism, such as this week, when the man leading a daily standup welcomed me by saying that he was glad I was joining them so that he had someone to give the pink cards to. Obviously, women want to be welcomed to the team because of the skills they bring, not so that they can take the pink cards that none of the men want to use. That's why it's important to bring more women into the tech world, and also to continue the conversation about gender equality, because it is still very prevalent, and exposure and education will make that change.</p>
  <p>Now, I have been lucky in that most of my teammates are young, active in the dev communities and accepting of new ideas. One coworker makes a special effort to address team emails to "Hey guys and gal," which is thoughtful and amusing. I don't mind being lumped in with "Hey guys," as that's just how our language works, but it is very kind that he is aware of it and makes the effort. Other times, though, I've had coworkers refer to <a href="http://www.girldevelopit.com/" title="Girl Develop It">Girl Develop it</a> as "a great place to meet women," completely missing the point. It's this default perspective towards women as "female, dateable objects" rather than as "equally intelligent people" that we're working to change.</p>
  <h2>Coworkers, Not Dating Fodder</h2>
  <p>As Chapter Leader and member of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/girldevelopitcbus" title="Columbus Girl Develop It">Columbus Girl Develop It</a> branch, I want to work towards the goal of women being viewed as coworkers, not a dating pool. Men are helpful and even necessary in the efforts to get more women into tech, and they should be welcomed as teachers and peers. In turn, women must be welcomed as peers as well, as equals, with the focus on their strengths as developers and not their act of being female. Once the novelty of having a woman among the guys has worn off, and enough cultural education has happened towards equality, women will be welcomed to the meetings because of their fantastic skill with CSS design, rather than merely as recipients of the pink cards.</p>

      We need more ladies at the meetings so the mens don't have to use the pink cards.

      <h3>Personal Thinking Style</h3>

<section>
  <p>Early in Phase 0 of Dev Bootcamp, we were all asked to go through a series of personal learning and thinking style websites and take the quizzes to establish our own results. The <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm" title="Gregorc Thinking Styles website">Gregorc thinking styles</a> approach was <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html" title="Gregorc quiz">one such analysis</a> we completed. My results were skewed in the direction of <strong>Abstract Random</strong> thought. My secondary strength scored in Abstract Sequential. Some of the descriptors for Abstract Random thinking do seem to fit me; for example, I do like harmony and healthy relationships, and find having to explain feelings challenging (writing is difficult for me for this reason, I have trouble explaining things in general). I also do indeed find concentrating on one thing at a time difficult and giving exact details.
  </p>
  <img src="/blog/dbc-blog-imgs/thinking-style.jpg" alt="Quiz result showing higher score in abstract random thought range" style="width: 40%; float: right;" />
  <p>However, of the four styles described on the website, I most identified with the <strong>Concrete Random</strong> results the most, even though I scored the lowest in this range on the quiz. Perhaps I took the test incorrectly or should take it again. However, there were many more points that resonated with me from Concrete Random than any others. In particular, I fit the following points:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The learner likes:
      <ul>
        <li>Experimenting to find answers</li>
        <li>Using intuition</li>
        <li>Solving problems independently</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>They learn best when:
      <ul>
        <li>Able to use trial-and-error</li>
        <li>Given opportunity to work through problems by themselves</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Hard for them:
      <ul>
        <li>Formal reports</li>
        <li>Re-doing anything once it's done</li>
        <li>Keeping detailed records</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>I diverge from the description in terms of wanting competition, and disliking limitations, showing my work, or having no options. I'm generally ambivalent on all of those points. Overall though, I do think I'm more in the Concrete Random/Abstract Random plains of thought than anything else.</p>
  <p>I can see how these styles of thinking can related to the challenges I have faced in P0 so far. One of the harder times I have is with planning pair sessions. Like Concrete Random thinkers, I prefer to work through difficult problems independently. I find that even when I do pair, I strongly prefer to do it remotely than in person. It was easier for me when we had a person in our group who was very extroverted and always planned pair sessions for us, but unfortunately she has left the program and I am missing her! I have now asked my accountability group to help me stay on track with pairing requirement and to give me reminders to schedule sessions.</p>
  <p>Another topic we were asked to consider was <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/taschen_informationgraphics10.jpg" title="Fixed vs growth mindset infographic">fixed vs growth mindsets</a>. The <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/" title="Fixed vs Growth Book">description of this dichotomy</a> implies that individuals have one or the other:</p>
  <blockquote>Out of these two mindsets, which we manifest from a very early age, springs a great deal of our behavior</blockquote>
  <p>But I think that I have at times parts of both. I admittedly know that I like to appear smart, but I also love to learn, am not afraid to show my ignorance, and will change previously held views when given evidence against them. As a younger girl, I often gave up when faced with obstacles or immense effort, which is actually <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-success/201101/the-trouble-bright-girls" title="Trouble with bright girls">a very common learned trait</a> among women. I also do learn from criticism and am delighted when others succeed. I think that we as people can often have both of these mindsets over time or in differing situations, and we can be aware of that and work towards keeping a growth mindset.</p>

      Strangely enough, this internet quiz didn't nail it.
