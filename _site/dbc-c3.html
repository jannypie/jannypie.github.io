<section>
  <p>Early in Phase 0 of Dev Bootcamp, we were all asked to go through a series of personal learning and thinking style websites and take the quizzes to establish our own results. The <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm" title="Gregorc Thinking Styles website">Gregorc thinking styles</a> approach was <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html" title="Gregorc quiz">one such analysis</a> we completed. My results were skewed in the direction of <strong>Abstract Random</strong> thought. My secondary strength scored in Abstract Sequential. Some of the descriptors for Abstract Random thinking do seem to fit me; for example, I do like harmony and healthy relationships, and find having to explain feelings challenging (writing is difficult for me for this reason, I have trouble explaining things in general). I also do indeed find concentrating on one thing at a time difficult and giving exact details.
  </p>
  <img src="/blog/dbc-blog-imgs/thinking-style.jpg" alt="Quiz result showing higher score in abstract random thought range" style="width: 40%; float: right;" />
  <p>However, of the four styles described on the website, I most identified with the <strong>Concrete Random</strong> results the most, even though I scored the lowest in this range on the quiz. Perhaps I took the test incorrectly or should take it again. However, there were many more points that resonated with me from Concrete Random than any others. In particular, I fit the following points:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The learner likes:
      <ul>
        <li>Experimenting to find answers</li>
        <li>Using intuition</li>
        <li>Solving problems independently</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>They learn best when:
      <ul>
        <li>Able to use trial-and-error</li>
        <li>Given opportunity to work through problems by themselves</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Hard for them:
      <ul>
        <li>Formal reports</li>
        <li>Re-doing anything once it's done</li>
        <li>Keeping detailed records</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>I diverge from the description in terms of wanting competition, and disliking limitations, showing my work, or having no options. I'm generally ambivalent on all of those points. Overall though, I do think I'm more in the Concrete Random/Abstract Random plains of thought than anything else.</p>
  <p>I can see how these styles of thinking can related to the challenges I have faced in P0 so far. One of the harder times I have is with planning pair sessions. Like Concrete Random thinkers, I prefer to work through difficult problems independently. I find that even when I do pair, I strongly prefer to do it remotely than in person. It was easier for me when we had a person in our group who was very extroverted and always planned pair sessions for us, but unfortunately she has left the program and I am missing her! I have now asked my accountability group to help me stay on track with pairing requirement and to give me reminders to schedule sessions.</p>
  <p>Another topic we were asked to consider was <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/taschen_informationgraphics10.jpg" title="Fixed vs growth mindset infographic">fixed vs growth mindsets</a>. The <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/" title="Fixed vs Growth Book">description of this dichotomy</a> implies that individuals have one or the other:</p>
  <blockquote>Out of these two mindsets, which we manifest from a very early age, springs a great deal of our behavior</blockquote>
  <p>But I think that I have at times parts of both. I admittedly know that I like to appear smart, but I also love to learn, am not afraid to show my ignorance, and will change previously held views when given evidence against them. As a younger girl, I often gave up when faced with obstacles or immense effort, which is actually <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-success/201101/the-trouble-bright-girls" title="Trouble with bright girls">a very common learned trait</a> among women. I also do learn from criticism and am delighted when others succeed. I think that we as people can often have both of these mindsets over time or in differing situations, and we can be aware of that and work towards keeping a growth mindset.</p>
