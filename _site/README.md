==================

I am a Web Developer with special interests in UX/UI and accessibility. After several years working in web design and front-end, I recently attended Dev Bootcamp in the Localhost pilot cohort in Columbus, OH, to complete my education in back-end programming.

As someone who loves both coding and design, I delight in bridging front-end and back-end development. My diverse background reflects curiosity, persistence, and an ability to adapt. I bring together tech skills and personal strengths to meet the challenge of the ever-evolving user experience.
