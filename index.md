  <p>Web Developer specializing in Front-End and UX/UI, with a professional background in research and design. As someone who loves both coding and design, I delight in bridging the two worlds. CSS and JavaScript are my passions as they are what bring the web to life, and deliver content to users in an infinite variety of ways.</p>
  <p>My story reflects curiosity, persistence, and an ability to adapt. An urge to always be learning coupled with a sense of compassion and empathy drive me to better myself so that I can better serve others. I believe that our current world of growing web and software applications means that the user experience is ever-evolving, and I bring together technical skills and personal strengths to meet that challenge.</p>
