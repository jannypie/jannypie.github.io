  <p>I am a Web Developer with special interests in UX/UI and accessibility. After several years working in web design and front-end, I recently attended <a href="http://devbootcamp.com" title="Dev Bootcamp website">Dev Bootcamp</a> in the <a href="http://local.devbootcamp.com" title="Information about the Localhost pilot">Localhost pilot cohort</a> in Columbus, OH, to complete my education in back-end programming.</p>
  <p>As someone who loves both coding and design, I delight in bridging front-end and back-end development. My diverse background reflects curiosity, persistence, and an ability to adapt. I bring together tech skills and personal strengths to meet the challenge of the ever-evolving user experience.</p>
  <p>I do not actually have a mustache.</p>
