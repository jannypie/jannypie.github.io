<p>Our team that built this project over a weekend as practice with complex modeling and associations in a database. We implemented a full Agile workflow with frequent standups and peer-pairing, task tracking and review, and a team retro. I implemented the UI as well as vertical slices for user CRUD and some game play.</p>
<p>Built with: Ruby, Rails, Active Record, CSS</p>
