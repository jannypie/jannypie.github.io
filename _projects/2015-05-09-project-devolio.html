  <p>DEVOLIO merges traditional resume information with GitHub/Twitter activity to quickly and easily produce an attractive, informative job search profile. The app is responsive to look great on mobile at conferences, printable to look like a traditional resume, and uses D3.js to animate real activity data from GitHub. </p>
