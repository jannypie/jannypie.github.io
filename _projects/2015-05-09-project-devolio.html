  <h2>Project Timespan: April 2015, ongoing</h2>
  <p>DEVOLIO merges traditional resume information with GitHub/Twitter activity to quickly and easily produce an attractive, informative job search profile. The app is responsive to look great on mobile at conferences, printable to look like a traditional resume, and uses D3.js to animate real activity data from GitHub. </p>
  <p>As the Team Lead, I coordinated the project, as well as heading up the UI, visual design and code, and the Backbone.js integration.</p>
  <p>Built with: Ruby, Rails, Backbone.js, JavaScript / AJAX, MongoDB, d3.js, GitHub API, Twitter API, Bootstrap responsive grid (custom design and CSS otherwise), Sass, CoffeeScript</p>
