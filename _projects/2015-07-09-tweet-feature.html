  <h3>Challenge</h3>
  <p>Fill-in-the-blank Tweets was initially a concept I implemented at Abercrombie &amp; Fitch for their annual Jeans Guide Experience. Visitors could tweet using the #JeansAddict hash tag and ask questions for advice.</p>
  <p><img src="/assets/project-images/Tweet-Dialogue.png" alt="JeansAddict concept" /></p>
  <p>I developed the JavaScript necessary for the implementation, and when it was live, several users made use of the feature.</p>

  </p>
  <p>For this CodePen prototype, I adapted the concept into a new UI with a cleaner dropdown effect using CSS3 Perspective and Transform. I also refactored the JavaScript as I found ways to make it cleaner and using fewer interactions with the DOM.</p>
  </ul>
