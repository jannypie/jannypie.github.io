  <h3>Challenge</h3>
  <p>Fill-in-the-blank Tweets was initially a concept I implemented at Abercrombie &amp; Fitch for their annual Jeans Guide experience. Visitors could tweet using the #JeansAddict hash tag and ask for advice on fits and washes.</p>
  <p><img src="/assets/project-images/Tweet-Dialogue.png" alt="JeansAddict concept" /></p>
  <p>I wrote the JavaScript necessary for the implementation, as well as the markup and styling to fit mockups from design. When it was live, many visitors made use of the feature.</p>

  <p>For this CodePen prototype, I adapted the concept into a new UI with a different dropdown effect using CSS3 Perspective and Transform. I also refactored the JavaScript as I found ways to make it cleaner and have fewer interactions with the DOM.</p>
